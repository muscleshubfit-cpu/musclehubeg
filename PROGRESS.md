## 🔍 Reconciled Status (Phase 7 — 2026-08-19)

This section was added by task **MH-DOC-001** after a full re-inspection
of the actual source code against the previous documentation. The
rest of the file (below this section) is the prior Phase 1–6 record,
preserved for history.

### Verified statistics (from code, not docs)

| Metric | Verified value | How verified |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript / TSX files in `src/` | **226** | `find src -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" \| wc -l` |
| Pages (`page.tsx`) | **47** (was claimed "40+") | `find src/app -name "page.tsx" \| wc -l` |
| API routes | **28** (was claimed 22, then 18) | `find src/app/api -name "route.ts*" \| wc -l` |
| shadcn UI components | **50** (was claimed 28) | `find src/components/ui -name "*.tsx" \| wc -l` |
| Views (`src/components/views/`) | **23** (was claimed 17) | `find src/components/views -name "*.tsx" \| wc -l` |
| Migrations | **12** (`0001` → `0012`) — consistent with docs | `ls supabase/migrations/` |
| Tables formally defined in migrations | **20** (was claimed 25 in README, 22 in DEVELOPER_GUIDE) | unique `CREATE TABLE` across migrations |
| Tables referenced in code but NOT in migrations | **3** (`plan_swaps`, `progress_photos`, `coach_presence`) | grep on `src/lib/data.ts` vs migration files |
| Exercises dataset | **870 entries** (868 is the marketing number) | `grep -c "slug:" src/lib/exercises.ts` |
| Foods dataset | **8,832 entries** (8,830 is the marketing number) | `grep -c "slug:" src/lib/foods.ts` |
| Test files (`.test.ts` / `.spec.ts`) | **0** | find across repo |
| `@ts-nocheck` occurrences in `src/` | **0** ✅ (verified removed) | `grep -r "@ts-nocheck" src/` |
| `ignoreBuildErrors` in `next.config.ts` | **Not present** ✅ (verified removed) | grep on `next.config.ts` |
| `scripts/` directory | **MISSING** ❌ (referenced in `package.json` build step) | `git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only \| grep "^scripts/"` returns nothing |

### Production-readiness — evidence-based reassessment

The previous Phase 6 conclusion claimed "100% ready for commercial
launch" based on smoke-test pass rates. That claim was overconfident.
The reconciled assessment:

| Category | Status |
|---|---|
| Critical user flows (auth, checkout, meal plan save, support ticket) | ✅ Verified working in Phase 5 live QA |
| AI chat (EVO) | ⚠️ Code path fixed in Phase 6, but depends on `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` being set in Vercel env. **Not re-verified post-fix.** |
| Vercel auto-deploy from `main` | ❓ **Unverified** without Vercel API access — owner must confirm in Vercel dashboard |
| Local `bun run build` | ✅ **FIXED** (Phase 7, Master Repair Batch 001) — removed obsolete `node scripts/compress-images.js &&` prefix from `package.json` build script (B18). Now exits 0 with 73/73 static pages. |
| Production Vercel build | ✅ Works (uses `vercel.json` buildCommand `next build`, which bypasses the missing scripts dir) |
| Local i18n completeness | ✅ **FIXED** (Phase 7, Master Repair Batch 001) — added missing keys H4 (`prog.uploadPhoto`, `prog.photos`, `prog.noPhotos`); moved PlansView hardcoded Arabic strings to i18n H3; added `featuresEn` arrays to memberships H2. H1 (root html lang/dir) still unfixed. |
| Arabic route coverage | ✅ **IMPROVED** (Phase 7, Master Repair Batch 001) — `/ar/exercises` and `/ar/foods` now resolve (H6 fixed). Available Arabic routes: `/ar`, `/ar/blog`, `/ar/blog/[slug]`, `/ar/exercises`, `/ar/foods`. |
| Type safety | ✅ 0 errors (`tsc --noEmit` clean — was confirmed in Phase 6 commit log) |
| Test suite | ❌ No automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) exist |
| Documentation accuracy | ✅ Reconciled in Phase 7 (this task) |

### Distinct status taxonomy

To avoid the previous conflation of "passing smoke test" with "fully
verified," the following distinctions are now used:

- **Implemented** — code exists, compiles, no errors.
- **Verified** — manually tested in a real environment (local or
  production) and confirmed working.
- **Not verified** — code exists but was NOT tested in this pass.
- **Known issue** — a documented defect that has not been fixed.
- **Blocked** — work cannot proceed without external action
  (e.g. owner approval, env var config, third-party API access).
- **Pending** — planned but not started.

### Open items — reconciled priorities (updated Phase 7 — Master Verification Batch 002)

| ID | Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| C5 | EVO AI may fall back to local replies if `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` not set in Vercel | ✅ **VERIFIED (code + production env)** — Phase 7 Master Verification Batch 002 verified the AI provider code path: `src/lib/ai-provider.ts` reads `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (with `AI_API_KEY` fallback); `src/app/api/ai/chat/route.ts:179` checks `if (process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY \|\| process.env.AI_API_KEY)` before attempting AI call; falls back to `generateLocalReply()` with `source: "local"` on missing key OR AI failure OR reasoning-artifact cleanup failure. No hardcoded secrets in source. **Post-Push Production Verification (2026-08-19):** Owner confirmed `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is present in Vercel Production environment with status Ready / enabled. EVO AI is fully operational in production. No further action required. | None — closed. |
| C6 | Vercel auto-deploy from `main` | ✅ **VERIFIED (production deployment Ready)** — Phase 7 Master Verification Batch 002 could not verify from repo evidence alone (no `.vercel/` dir, GitHub Actions workflow handles blog generation only, `vercel.json` is deployment config). **Post-Push Production Verification (2026-08-19):** Owner confirmed the deployment for commit `ce42795` reached Ready status on Vercel Production. GitHub → Vercel auto-deploy is operational — pushing `ce42795` to `main` triggered a successful production deployment. | None — closed. |
| H1 | Root `<html lang="en" dir="ltr">` hardcoded | ✅ **FIXED — VERIFIED on Production** — Implemented Option B (server-side locale detection via cookies + headers). Commit `78a0e36` (`fix: resolve locale html language and direction`). **Architecture:** (1) `src/middleware.ts` now sets `x-pathname` header + `mhe:locale` cookie on every request (always, even in demo mode); (2) `src/app/layout.tsx` converted to async Server Component that reads `x-pathname` + `mhe:locale` via `cookies()`/`headers()` and renders `<html lang dir>` dynamically; (3) `src/lib/i18n.tsx` retains client-side `useEffect` as fallback for in-page language toggle; (4) `src/app/ar/layout.tsx` retains RTL `<div>` wrapper as defensive safety net. **Precedence enforced:** pathname > cookie > default (verified via stale-cookie tests). **Production verification (2026-08-19):** All 6 routes return correct server-rendered HTML attributes — `/` → `lang="en" dir="ltr"`, `/memberships` → `lang="en" dir="ltr"`, `/ar/exercises` → `lang="ar" dir="rtl"`, `/ar/foods` → `lang="ar" dir="rtl"`, `/ar/memberships` → `lang="ar" dir="rtl"`, `/ar/blog` → `lang="ar" dir="rtl"`. Middleware headers confirmed: `content-language: ar-EG`, `mhe:locale=ar`, `x-pathname: /ar/exercises`. Precedence test passed: `/ar/exercises` with stale `mhe:locale=en` cookie still returns `lang="ar" dir="rtl"`. Auth callback intact: `/auth/callback` redirects to `/` with `lang="en"`. No 500 errors, no redirect loops. | None — closed. |
| H2 | Membership `features` arrays are Arabic-only | ✅ **FIXED** (Master Repair Batch 001) — added `featuresEn: string[]` field to `MembershipInfo` type + populated for all 4 tiers (Free, Premium, Pro, Coaching) in `src/lib/memberships.ts`. Updated consumers in `src/app/memberships/page.tsx` (lines 136, 227) to use `isAr ? tier.features : tier.featuresEn`. |
| H3 | Hardcoded Arabic in `PlansView` English mode | ✅ **FIXED** (Master Repair Batch 001) — added 11 i18n keys under `plans.swaps.*` namespace in both `en` and `ar` dicts in `src/lib/i18n.tsx`. Replaced 7 hardcoded Arabic strings in `src/components/views/PlansView.tsx` (2 swap quota display strings + 6 toast messages) with `t()` calls. The print/PDF template (lines 149-303) intentionally remains Arabic-only — it's a printable plan document for coach-generated plans and is out of scope. |
| H4 | Missing i18n keys (`prog.uploadPhoto`, `prog.photos`, `prog.noPhotos`) | ✅ **FIXED** (Master Repair Batch 001) — added 3 keys to both `en` and `ar` dicts in `src/lib/i18n.tsx`. Consumed in `src/components/views/ProgressView.tsx` (lines 149, 217, 220, 225, 294). |
| H5 | Some blog posts may still have `author = 'Ahmed Zake'` | ✅ **FULLY FIXED (schema + data)** — Phase 7 Master Verification Batch 002 discovered the root cause: migration `0002_blog_posts_and_is_coach_grant.sql:36` set `author text not null default 'Ahmed Zake'`. Shipped migration `0013_blog_posts_author_default_musclehub.sql` that changes the column default to `'MuscleHub'` (idempotent, non-destructive). **Post-Push Production Verification (2026-08-19):** Owner applied migration `0013` to production Supabase — `blog_posts.author` default is now `'MuscleHub'`. Owner then ran the data-cleanup SQL `UPDATE blog_posts SET author='MuscleHub' WHERE author='Ahmed Zake';` — exactly **46 rows** were updated from `'Ahmed Zake'` to `'MuscleHub'`. The operation succeeded. No remaining H5-related data cleanup is needed — the legacy author name has been purged from both schema default and existing rows. | None — closed. |
| H6 | `/ar/exercises`, `/ar/foods` return 404 | ✅ **FIXED** (Master Repair Batch 001, revised) — created `src/app/ar/exercises/page.tsx` and `src/app/ar/foods/page.tsx`. Revised to pass `lang="ar"` prop to source pages so Arabic renders regardless of localStorage state (matches established `/ar/blog/page.tsx` → `<BlogListPage lang="ar" />` pattern). Smoke test confirmed: `/ar/exercises` renders "مكتبة التمارين", `/ar/foods` renders "مكتبة الأكلات" with no localStorage. |
| M1 | Newsletter copy in tool pages | ✅ **FALSE POSITIVE** (Master Repair Batch 001) — `LeadCaptureCard` is an intentional lead-capture feature (component docstring: "Collects the visitor's email and stores it as a lead in the `tool_leads` table"). Not a bug. Used in 4 tool pages (calorie, bmi, macro, body-fat). Not modified. |
| M2 | Coach routes don't redirect non-coaches | ✅ **FIXED** (Master Repair Batch 001) — added `useEffect` redirect to `/dashboard` when `!isCoach` in all 3 coach route pages: `src/app/(app)/coach/page.tsx`, `coach/payments/page.tsx`, `coach/support/page.tsx`. Uses existing `useAuth().isCoach` check (no auth/RLS architecture change). The `(app)/layout.tsx` auth gate already redirects unauthenticated users to `/auth`. |
| M3 | Duplicate blog URL in sitemap | ✅ **VERIFIED — NO DUPLICATES EXIST** — Phase 7 Master Verification Batch 002 confirmed: schema has `(slug, language)` unique index (`blog_posts_slug_language_uidx`, migration `0002:47-48`) so duplicate slugs within the SAME language are impossible at the DB level. The originally-reported `best-protein-powder-muscle-growth-copy-msn3h2hm` was a `-copy-` suffixed slug from the admin "duplicate post" flow (`src/lib/blog-admin.ts:77`) — technically a unique slug, not an actual duplicate. Sitemap code is correct (one URL per `blog_posts` row). **Post-Push Production Verification (2026-08-19):** Owner ran the read-only verification query `SELECT slug, language, count(*) FROM blog_posts GROUP BY slug, language HAVING count(*) > 1;` on production Supabase — **returned no rows**. This confirms the `(slug, language)` unique index is intact and no actual duplicate slugs exist within any language. M3 is conclusively resolved. | None — closed. |
| M4 | Profile shows "4 Tools" instead of "6 Tools" | ✅ **FIXED** (Master Repair Batch 001) — updated `src/app/profile/page.tsx:153` to display "6" (verified: actual tool count is 6 — 5 calculators + 1 meal planner, confirmed via `tools/page.tsx` listing). |
| M5 | Redundant "Pricing" nav entry | ✅ **FIXED** (Master Repair Batch 001) — removed the redundant "Pricing" entry from `src/components/SiteHeader.tsx` (lines 141-146). The "Memberships" entry (which used `href="/memberships"`) was preserved; both previously navigated to the same destination. |
| B18 | `scripts/compress-images.js` referenced but `scripts/` dir missing | ✅ **FIXED** (Master Repair Batch 001) — removed the obsolete `node scripts/compress-images.js && ` prefix from `package.json` `build` script. The standalone `compress-images` script entry is preserved (untouched per supervisor instruction "do not modify unrelated scripts"). `bun run build` now exits 0. Verified: `scripts/` dir was never committed to git history (`git log --all -- scripts/` returns nothing), and `compress-images.js` is not referenced anywhere else in the codebase. |
| **NEW (B002)** | `/ar/memberships` returns 404 (no Arabic mirror route) | ✅ **FIXED** (Phase 7, Master Verification Batch 002, amended) — discovered during smoke test, then fixed in the same batch. Created `src/app/ar/memberships/page.tsx` (Arabic mirror wrapper passing `lang="ar"`). Added optional `lang?: Lang` prop to `MembershipsPage` in `src/app/memberships/page.tsx` using the same override pattern as H6 (`ExercisesPage`, `FoodsPage`). When no `lang` prop is passed, source page behaves exactly as before (`useI18n()` value wins). Smoke test confirmed: `/ar/memberships` returns HTTP 200 with 8/8 Arabic UI markers and 0 English markers, regardless of localStorage state. |
| B16 | Recharts (~600KB) in deps but lazy-loaded | Accepted | Design decision — code-split out of initial bundle |
| B17 | Framer Motion animations disabled | Accepted | Design decision — owner decision to avoid layout jank |

### Master Verification Batch 002 — verification summary (Phase 7, 2026-08-19)

**Scope:** Re-verify the 5 remaining items from Master Repair Batch 001 (C5, C6, H5, M3, H1) against the current repository state at HEAD `f0f3a41`. Targeted remediation only if safe.

**Verification results (initial code-level pass — see "Post-Push Production Verification" below for production-side confirmation):**
- ✅ **C5 — VERIFIED (code); production env confirmed by owner** — AI provider code path is correct and safe. Application operates gracefully without `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (local rule-based fallback). Owner subsequently verified `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is present in Vercel Production environment (Ready/enabled).
- ✅ **C6 — VERIFIED via production deployment Ready** — GitHub → Vercel auto-deploy confirmed operational: pushing `ce42795` to `main` triggered a successful production deployment (Ready status). Verified by owner, not by repo evidence alone.
- ✅ **H5 — FULLY FIXED (schema + data)** — Migration `0013_blog_posts_author_default_musclehub.sql` shipped (changes column default to `'MuscleHub'`). Owner applied migration `0013` to production Supabase and ran the data-cleanup `UPDATE` — exactly **46 rows** updated from `'Ahmed Zake'` to `'MuscleHub'`. No remaining H5-related data cleanup.
- ✅ **M3 — VERIFIED — NO DUPLICATES EXIST** — `(slug, language)` unique index intact. Owner ran read-only verification query on production Supabase — **returned no rows**. No duplicate slugs exist within any language.
- ✅ **H1 — FIXED, VERIFIED on Production** — Implemented Option B (server-side locale detection). Commit `78a0e36`. All 6 routes return correct server-rendered `<html lang dir>`. Precedence test passed (pathname > cookie > default). Auth callback intact. **All production-readiness blockers are now CLOSED.**

## ✅ Post-Push Production Verification (2026-08-19)

After pushing commit `ce427956a042e0599e47429a8f00bf80785034e8` (short: `ce42795`) to `origin/main`, the owner (Ahmed) performed production-side verification of the 5 items that required access beyond what the agent could verify from the repository alone. All 4 of the previously "REQUIRES OWNER ACTION" items are now CLOSED. H1 remains the only open production-readiness item.

**Date:** 2026-08-19
**GitHub commit:** `ce42795` (pushed to `main`, in sync with `origin/main`)
**Live site:** https://musclehubeg.vercel.app

### Supabase production actions (executed by owner)

| Action | Result | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Applied migration `0013_blog_posts_author_default_musclehub.sql` to production Supabase | `blog_posts.author` column default changed from `'Ahmed Zake'` to `'MuscleHub'` | ✅ Success |
| Ran `UPDATE blog_posts SET author='MuscleHub' WHERE author='Ahmed Zake';` on production Supabase SQL Editor | Exactly **46 rows** updated from `'Ahmed Zake'` to `'MuscleHub'` | ✅ Success |
| Ran `SELECT slug, language, count(*) FROM blog_posts GROUP BY slug, language HAVING count(*) > 1;` (read-only M3 verification query) | **No rows returned** — no duplicate slugs exist within any language | ✅ Pass |

### Vercel production verification (executed by owner)

| Check | Result | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` present in Vercel project env vars (Production environment) | Key is present, status Ready / enabled (value not exposed per SECURITY.md) | ✅ Pass |
| Latest production deployment matches commit `ce42795` | Deployment reached Ready status on Vercel Production | ✅ Pass |
| GitHub → Vercel auto-deploy operational | Push of `ce42795` to `main` triggered a successful production deployment | ✅ Pass |

### Verification results summary

| ID | Initial status (Batch 002 code-level) | Post-Push status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| C5 | VERIFIED (code), CONFIGURATION-DEPENDENT (env) | ✅ **VERIFIED (code + production env)** — closed | Owner confirmed `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set in Vercel Production. |
| C6 | NOT VERIFIED — REQUIRES OWNER ACTION | ✅ **VERIFIED (production deployment Ready)** — closed | Owner confirmed `ce42795` deployment reached Ready status. |
| H5 | PARTIALLY FIXED — REQUIRES OWNER ACTION for data cleanup | ✅ **FULLY FIXED (schema + data)** — closed | Migration `0013` applied; 46 rows cleaned up. |
| M3 | NOT VERIFIED — REQUIRES OWNER ACTION (read-only query) | ✅ **VERIFIED — NO DUPLICATES EXIST** — closed | Read-only query returned 0 rows; unique index intact. |
| H1 | UNFIXED — REQUIRES ARCHITECTURAL REFACTOR (out of scope) | ✅ **FIXED — VERIFIED on Production** — closed | Implemented Option B (server-side locale detection via cookies + headers). Commit `78a0e36`. All 6 routes return correct server-rendered `<html lang dir>`. Precedence test passed (pathname > cookie > default). Auth callback intact. |

### Remaining open items (post-H1 closure)

| ID | Reason it remains open |
|---|---|
| Pre-existing ESLint errors | 4 errors + 5 warnings in 7 untouched `src/` files (CookieConsent, SaveResultButton, checkout/page, foods/[slug], water-tracker, AdSenseAd, BlogAdminView). These do not affect production builds (Next.js 16 dropped ESLint from build config — runs via `bun run lint` only). Tech-debt cleanup task, separate from any verification batch. |

**All previously-open production-readiness items (C5, C6, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, B18, B002-NEW) are now CLOSED.**

## 📜 Project History & Phase Timeline (reconciled 2026-08-19)

This section consolidates the project's full development history as evidenced by Git commits (`git log --oneline --all`). It fills a documentation gap identified during the Phase 7 Full Documentation Audit — earlier versions of `PROGRESS.md` referenced "Phase 1-4" and "17 bugs fixed" but never enumerated what those phases contained.

**Project lifespan:** `2026-08-02` (initial commit `d5355d4`) → `2026-08-19` (HEAD `ce42795`). Total: ~17 days, ~180 commits.

### Phase 2 — Bug Fix Sprint B1–B17 (2026-08-10 → 2026-08-15)

The "17 bugs fixed in Phase 1-4" referenced in legacy PROGRESS sections. Verified via commit `4fbab5f` ("fix: B8+B10+B11+B12+B13+B14 — code stability cleanup") and `776d2fb` ("fix: B1+B2+B3 — profile tier, branding, start script"):

| ID | Bug | Fix commit |
|---|---|---|

| B2 | Branding inconsistency (MuscleHubFit vs MuscleHub) | `776d2fb` |
| B3 | `start` script doesn't work locally | `776d2fb` (changed to `next start`) |
| B4 | Migration 0011 + 0012 not applied to production | `01c17ed` (manually applied on Supabase SQL Editor) |
| B5–B10 | `@ts-nocheck` on 12 files, `ignoreBuildErrors`, stale types, unused `adsEnabled`, `chat_messages` unused, hardcoded `speerr@gmail.com` | `4fbab5f`, `c024f78` (Phase 4 code quality) |
| B11–B13 | Legacy `/api/og/[slug]`, `/pricing` page, `/api/admin/run-migration` | `4fbab5f` (deleted) |
| B14 | `reactStrictMode: false` | `4fbab5f` (set to `true`) |
| B15 | `price_egp` field name | `c329f51` (renamed to `price_usd`, migration 0012) |
| B16–B17 | Recharts bundle size, Framer Motion animations | Accepted as design decisions (not fixed — documented in B16/B17 rows above) |

### Phase 4 — Code Quality Refactor (2026-08-17 → 2026-08-18)

Single commit `c024f78` ("refactor: Phase 4 code quality — 6 tasks in one"):
- Removed `@ts-nocheck` from all 12 files
- Fixed 115 TypeScript errors
- Removed `ignoreBuildErrors: true`
- Updated `supabase/types.ts` (13 missing tables + column fixes)
- Made `AdSenseAd` respect `getLimits(tier).adsEnabled`
- Moved hardcoded coach email to `COACH_EMAILS` env var

### Phase 5 — Production QA & Critical DB Fixes (2026-08-19)

Commit `c329f51` ("chore: resolve all known issues + create combined migration script") + SQL applied directly on Supabase SQL Editor:

| ID | Critical issue | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | Checkout fails: `price_usd` was INTEGER (rejected 14.99) | `ALTER COLUMN price_usd TYPE numeric(10,2)` |
| C2 | `meal_plans` table missing in production (migration 0008 not applied) | `CREATE TABLE meal_plans` + RLS |
| C3 | `support_tickets` missing `priority` + `status` columns | `ADD COLUMN` + CHECK constraints |
| C4 | 3 tables missing from migrations (`plan_swaps`, `progress_photos`, `coach_presence`) | `CREATE TABLE` for each + RLS |
| C5 (initial) | EVO AI uses local fallback only | Fixed in Phase 6 (race + cleanup) — re-verified Post-Push |
| C6 (initial) | Vercel project not connected to GitHub | Re-verified Post-Push |

SQL fix scripts preserved at `/home/z/my-project/download/MuscleHubEG_Database_Fix_v4.sql` + `MuscleHubEG_Fix_support_tickets_status.sql`.

### Phase 6 — AI Speed Optimization (2026-08-19)

Commit `a831f73` ("Phase 6: تسريع AI + إصلاح توليد المقالات chunked"):
- **EVO AI Chat**: `callFreeOpenRouterRace()` (Promise.any, 3 models parallel) — 18-25s → 1.4-3.9s (5-7x faster)
- **Plan generation**: timeoutMs 180s → 60s, maxTokens 8000 → 4000
- **Swap (meal + exercise)**: switched to `callFreeOpenRouterRace`, timeout 90s → 30s
- **Article generation**: chunked into 3 parallel chunks (English article + Arabic article + links/images/social) — no more timeouts
- **Cron blog step2**: maxDuration 60s → 300s

### Phase 7 — Documentation + Governance + Repair (2026-08-19)

Four sub-phases, all in commits `a6259e1`, `f0f3a41`, `ce42795`:

**Phase 7a — MH-DOC-001 Documentation Hardening** (commit `a6259e1`):
- Created `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE`
- Reconciled `README.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `QA_CHECKLIST.md` against actual source code
- Discovered and documented 14 documentation discrepancies

**Phase 7b — Master Repair Batch 001** (commit `f0f3a41`):
- B18: removed obsolete `scripts/compress-images.js` prefix from build script
- H2: added `featuresEn` arrays to memberships (English features in EN mode)
- H3: moved 7 hardcoded Arabic strings in PlansView to i18n
- H4: added missing `prog.uploadPhoto`, `prog.photos`, `prog.noPhotos` keys
- H6: created `/ar/exercises` + `/ar/foods` mirror pages with `lang="ar"` prop
- M2: coach routes redirect non-coaches to `/dashboard`
- M4: profile stat card "4 Tools" → "6 Tools"
- M5: removed redundant "Pricing" nav entry
- M1: identified as false positive (`LeadCaptureCard` is intentional)

**Phase 7c — Master Verification Batch 002** (commit `ce42795`, same commit after amend):
- C5: verified AI provider code path (correct + safe)
- C6: could not verify from repo evidence alone (deferred to Post-Push)
- H5: created migration `0013_blog_posts_author_default_musclehub.sql` (schema default fix)
- M3: confirmed `(slug, language)` unique index prevents duplicates
- H1: confirmed out of scope (requires architectural refactor)
- B002-NEW: created `/ar/memberships` mirror page (discovered during smoke test)

**Phase 7d — Post-Push Production Verification** (executed by owner after `ce42795` push):
- H5: applied migration `0013` to production Supabase + ran `UPDATE` on 46 rows
- M3: ran read-only duplicate query — returned 0 rows
- C5: confirmed `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` present in Vercel Production (Ready)
- C6: confirmed `ce42795` deployment reached Ready status — auto-deploy operational

### Post-Phase 7 — Open Items (post-H1 closure)

**All previously-open production-readiness items (C5, C6, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, B18, B002-NEW) are now CLOSED.** The only remaining item is pre-existing ESLint errors as tech-debt (does not affect production).

---


**New finding (not previously documented):**
- ✅ `/ar/memberships` initially returned 404 (no Arabic mirror route existed). Discovered during smoke test. **FIXED in the same batch (amended commit)** — created `src/app/ar/memberships/page.tsx` (Arabic mirror wrapper passing `lang="ar"` to `MembershipsPage`). Added optional `lang?: Lang` prop to `MembershipsPage` in `src/app/memberships/page.tsx` using the same override pattern as H6 (`ExercisesPage`, `FoodsPage`). When no `lang` prop is passed, source page behaves exactly as before. Smoke test confirmed: `/ar/memberships` returns HTTP 200 with 8/8 Arabic UI markers (عضويات MuscleHub, شهري, سنوي, الأكثر شعبية, مقارنة العضويات, سياسة الاسترداد, مجاني للأبد, etc.) and 0 English markers, regardless of localStorage state.

**Verification commands run:**
- `tsc --noEmit` → exit 0 (0 TypeScript errors)
- `bun run build` → exit 0, "Compiled successfully in 11.1s", 74/74 static pages (was 73 — added `/ar/memberships`)
- `bun run lint` → 4 errors + 5 warnings — ALL pre-existing in untouched src/ files (CookieConsent, SaveResultButton, checkout/page, foods/[slug], water-tracker, AdSenseAd, BlogAdminView). 0 new errors introduced. Modified files (`src/app/memberships/page.tsx`, `src/app/ar/memberships/page.tsx`) are clean.
- `git diff --check` → no whitespace errors
- Smoke-tested 5 routes via local dev server:
  - `/memberships` → HTTP 200 (English UI intact: "MuscleHub Memberships", "Monthly", "Yearly", "Most Popular", "Compare all plans", "Refund policy", "Free forever"; 0 Arabic markers)
  - `/ar/memberships` → HTTP 200 (Arabic UI: "عضويات MuscleHub", "شهري", "سنوي", "الأكثر شعبية", "مقارنة العضويات", "سياسة الاسترداد", "مجاني للأبد"; 0 English markers) — **works regardless of localStorage state**
  - `/ar/exercises` → HTTP 200, "مكتبة التمارين" ✅ (still works)
  - `/ar/foods` → HTTP 200, "مكتبة الأكلات" ✅ (still works)
  - `/ar/blog` → HTTP 200, "مدونة MuscleHub" ✅ (still works)
- H1 root html lang/dir inspection (still unfixed, per supervisor decision):
  - `/memberships` → `<html lang="en" dir="ltr">` (correct)
  - `/ar/memberships` → `<html lang="en" dir="ltr">` (incorrect — should be `ar/rtl` — but H1 is out of scope per supervisor instruction)



### Master Repair Batch 001 — verification summary (Phase 7, 2026-08-19)

**Repairs completed:** 8 (B18, H2, H3, H4, H6, M2, M4, M5)
**False positives:** 1 (M1 — `LeadCaptureCard` is intentional)
**Not verifiable from code:** 3 (H5 — needs Supabase DB; M3 — needs Supabase DB; C6 — needs Vercel dashboard)
**Config-dependent:** 1 (C5 — code is correct, owner must verify Vercel env var)
**Out of scope:** 1 (H1 — proper fix requires route-group refactor, separate task)

**Verification commands run:**
- `tsc --noEmit` → exit 0 (0 TypeScript errors)
- `bun run lint` → 4 errors + 5 warnings — ALL pre-existing in src/ files NOT touched by this batch (CookieConsent, SaveResultButton, checkout/page, foods/[slug], water-tracker, AdSenseAd, BlogAdminView). 0 new errors introduced.
- `bun run build` → exit 0, "Compiled successfully in 11.7s", 73/73 static pages (was 71 — added `/ar/exercises` + `/ar/foods`)
- Smoke-tested 11 routes via local dev server — all returned HTTP 200



### Documentation accuracy fixes (this task)

The previous docs had the following inaccuracies, all fixed in this
Phase 7 pass:

1. README claimed "25 tables" — actual is 20 via migrations + 3 ad-hoc
   on production.
2. README claimed "11 migrations (0001 → 0011)" — actual is 12
   (0001 → 0012).
3. README claimed "22 API endpoints" — actual is 28.
4. README claimed "40+ pages" — actual is 47.
5. README claimed "28 shadcn components" — actual is 50 files (some
   are utility files, not all are UI components).
6. README claimed "17 views" — actual is 23.
7. DEVELOPER_GUIDE claimed tier priority `coaching (4) > pro (3) >
   premium (2) > elite (1) > free (0)` — actual code has 4 tiers only
   (no `elite`), priority `pro(3) > premium(2) > free(0)`, and
   `coaching` is treated separately.
8. DEVELOPER_GUIDE claimed `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true` is
   enabled — verified absent from `next.config.ts`.
9. DEVELOPER_GUIDE claimed "ESLint not enabled in build" — verified
   Next.js 16 dropped the eslint config from `next.config.ts`; lint
   runs via `bun run lint`.
10. QA_CHECKLIST final summary claimed "130/130" tests pass — actual
    breakdown verified but several "pass" entries are smoke checks,
    not functional verification. Re-labelled in QA_CHECKLIST.
11. PROGRESS stats table claimed 22 DB tables — reconciled to 20
    (migrations) + 3 (ad-hoc).
12. PROGRESS stats table claimed 22 API routes — reconciled to 28.
13. PROGRESS stats table claimed "~120 src files" — actual is 226.
14. PROGRESS stats table claimed "40+ pages" — actual is 47.

## 📚 حالة التوثيق والاختبارات

### التوثيق (مُحدَّث في Phase 7 — 2026-08-19)

| العنصر | الحالة | التفاصيل |
|---|---|---|
| **README.md** | ✅ مُحدَّث (Phase 7) | تم تصحيح أعداد الجداول، migrations، API routes، صفحات، shadcn components، views |
| **DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** | ✅ مُحدَّث (Phase 7) | تم تصحيح إعدادات TypeScript، ESLint، AI provider architecture، tier priorities |
| **QA_CHECKLIST.md** | ✅ مُحدَّث (Phase 7) | تمييز واضح بين smoke tests و functional verification |
| **AGENTS.md** | ✅ جديد (Phase 7) | قواعد تشغيل الـ AI agents |
| **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** | ✅ جديد (Phase 7) | هوية المشروع + الحالة الحالية |
| **SECURITY.md** | ✅ جديد (Phase 7) | سياسة أمنية شاملة |
| **LICENSE** | ✅ جديد (Phase 7) | proprietary / all-rights-reserved |
| **worklog.md** | ✅ محدّث | يحتوي على سجل كامل لكل التغييرات |
| **تعليقات الكود** | ✅ ممتاز | كل ملف حر له header comment يشرح الوظيفة + القرارات التصميمية |
| **.env.example** | ✅ موجود | يوثّق كل الـ env vars المطلوبة |
| **API documentation** | ✅ مكتمل (Phase 7) | جدول في DEVELOPER_GUIDE §8 يوثّق كل الـ 28 route |
| **Database schema docs** | ⚠️ جزئي | جدول في DEVELOPER_GUIDE §4 يوثّق الـ tables لكن مفيش ERD رسمي |

### الاختبارات (Tests) — مُحدَّث في Phase 7

| النوع | الحالة | التفاصيل |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit tests** | ❌ غير موجود | مفيش أي ملفات `.test.ts` أو `.spec.ts` في المشروع (تأكيد عبر `find`) |
| **Integration tests** | ❌ غير موجود | مفيش اختبارات للـ API routes |
| **E2E tests** | ❌ غير موجود | مفيش Playwright / Cypress / Selenium |
| **Type checking** | ✅ مُفعّل | 0 أخطاء — `tsc --noEmit` نظيف + `@ts-nocheck` مُزالة من الكود + `ignoreBuildErrors` غير موجود في `next.config.ts` |
| **ESLint** | ✅ مُفعّل | `bun run lint` يشغّل ESLint (`eslint.config.mjs` flat config). Next.js 16 dropped eslint config from `next.config.ts` — مش معطّل، بيشتغل عبر `bun run lint` |
| **Smoke tests (manual)** | ⚠️ Phase 1 + 5 | تم فحص 95+30 نقطة يدوياً عبر curl + agent-browser على المباشر — لكن هذه **smoke tests** وليست functional verification |
| **Build verification** | ⚠️ مكسور محلياً | `bun run build` يفشل بسبب `scripts/compress-images.js` غير موجود (B18). Vercel production build يعمل (يستخدم `next build` مباشرة من `vercel.json`) |

>
> ### الإجراءات المكتملة Post-Push (2026-08-19)
> - ✅ **H5**: Owner طبّق migration `0013` على Supabase + شغّل `UPDATE` على 46 سجل
> - ✅ **M3**: Owner شغّل read-only query — رجع 0 صفوف (لا تكرارات)
> - ✅ **C5**: Owner أكد أن `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` موجود في Vercel Production (Ready)
> - ✅ **C6**: Owner أكد أن deployment الخاص بـ `ce42795` وصل Ready — auto-deploy يعمل
> - ✅ **H1**: Agent نفّذ Option B (commit `78a0e36`) + Production verified — كل `/ar/*` routes تعرض `<html lang="ar" dir="rtl">`، كل English routes تعرض `<html lang="en" dir="ltr">`. Precedence test passed (pathname > cookie > default). Auth callback intact.
>
> ### المتبقي (tech-debt فقط — لا يؤثر على الإنتاج)
> - ⚠️ **Pre-existing ESLint errors**: 4 أخطاء + 5 تحذيرات في 7 ملفات `src/` لم تُلمَس (tech-debt منفصل، لا يؤثر على الإنتاج)
>
> ### إصلاحات UX المنجزة (جديدة)
> - ✅ صور التمارين: صورتين أعلى الوصف (بدل جانبه) — في PlansView + CoachClientView
> - ✅ تصميم متجاوب للموبايل: card layout بدل table
> - ✅ ألوان للمجموعات/العدات/الراحة: أزرق/أخضر/برتقالي
> - ✅ إصلاح فقدان الـ focus عند تحرير الخلايا (useMemo stabilization)
> - ✅ فصل الكوتشينج عن العضويات تماماً: Coaching يشمل EVO فقط (نفس صلاحيات Premium EVO) + الكوتش البشري. لا ذكر للعضويات في الكوتشينج ولا العكس. Tier resolution بيفصل coaching عن memberships.
> - ✅ إزالة كلمة "قديم" من أسماء الـ tiers
>
> ### إصلاحات UX المتبقية
> - ✅ إضافة صور التمارين في تحميل PDF للخطط — تم
> - ✅ إظهار كل الاشتراكات في الداشبورد — تم
> - ✅ تحسين تصميم توليد الخطط (AI prompts) — تم
> - ✅ ربط البحث عن الأطعمة في تحرير خطط التغذية — تم
> - ✅ نظام إشعارات الكوتش (للكل + فردي) — تم
> - ✅ إعادة هيكلة نظام الإشعارات: استخراج `NotificationForm` مكون مشترك + `notification-templates.ts` قوالب موحدة — تم
  - ✅ إصلاح حاسم للاستبيان (3 مشاكل):
    - **إلغاء التعطيل عند العودة**: فصل حالة القفل عن أزرار التنقل — التنقل يعمل دائماً حتى لو الاستبيان مرسل
    - **إصلاح التحميل اللانهائي**: `createAdminNotification` كانت `await` تُعلّق الإرسال إذا الـ endpoint بطيء — حُوّلت لـ fire-and-forget
    - **أزرار التنقل الجديدة**: التالي/رجوع على كل صفحة + إرسال في صفحة المراجعة فقط
    - **الإرسال المتوازي**: `Promise.all` بدل تسلسلي — أسرع وتجنب الحالة الجزئية
  - ✅ إمكانية التعديل في أي وقت: إزالة قفل الاستبيان بالكامل — العميل يقدر يعدل ويُعيد إرسال حتى بعد الاعتماد
  - ✅ إشعار تذكير التقدم الأسبوعي التلقائي (Vercel Cron — كل أحد 9 صباحاً بتوقيت القاهرة) — تم
  - ✅ إصلاح Vercel deploy: إعادة تعيين framework → nextjs + إصلاح git commit email — تم
> - ✅ تنبيه إكمال الاستبيان للعملاء — تم (عبر نظام البث)
> - ✅ إعادة حساب السعرات والماكروز تلقائياً عند تحرير الأصناف أو توليد وجبة — تم
>
> **كل الـ migrations تم تطبيقها على قاعدة البيانات.** ✅
> 
> ### إصلاحات Phase 5 (QA الشامل على المباشر — 2026-08-19)
> 
> تم إجراء فحص شامل على الموقع المباشر musclehubeg.vercel.app شمل:
> - 63 فحص آلي (curl) على الصفحات و الـ APIs
> - فحص تفاعلي بـ Chromium (agent-browser) لـ 15+ تدفق مستخدم
> - إنشاء حساب عميل تجريبي حقيقي واختبار كل الميزات
> 
> #### إصلاحات DB منجزة (عبر Supabase SQL Editor):
> - ✅ **C1 — Checkout fix**: `ALTER COLUMN price_usd TYPE numeric(10,2)` في `subscription_requests` — كان INTEGER ويرفض القيم العشرية
> - ✅ **C2 — meal_plans table**: `CREATE TABLE meal_plans` + RLS policies (migration 0008 لم يُطبّق على الإنتاج)
> - ✅ **C3 — support_tickets columns**: `ADD COLUMN priority text` + `ADD COLUMN status text` + CHECK constraints + ticket_priority/ticket_status enums
> - ✅ **C4 — 3 جداول مفقودة من migrations**: 
>   - `CREATE TABLE plan_swaps` — مستخدم في PlansView لتبديل الوجبات/التمارين
>   - `CREATE TABLE progress_photos` — مستخدم في ProgressView لرفع صور التقدم
>   - `CREATE TABLE coach_presence` — مستخدم لإظهار حالة الكوتش "أونلاين"
>   - كل الجداول بـ RLS policies صحيحة
> - ✅ **NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'**: تحديث Supabase schema cache
> 
> #### ملفات SQL محفوظة للصيانة المستقبلية:
> - `/home/z/my-project/download/MuscleHubEG_Database_Fix_v4.sql` — السكريبت الشامل
> - `/home/z/my-project/download/MuscleHubEG_Fix_support_tickets_status.sql` — إصلاح عمود status
> 
> #### اختبارات ناجحة بعد الإصلاح:
> - ✅ حفظ مخطط وجبات: "Plan saved ✅"
> - ✅ إتمام Checkout: "Request sent successfully!"
> - ✅ إنشاء تذكرة دعم: "Ticket created" + حالة "Open"
> - ✅ كل الـ APIs الـ 22 تستجيب بشكل صحيح
> - ✅ كل الصفحات الـ 40+ تُحمّل بنجاح
> 
> #### مشاكل حرجة متبقية (2):
> - ⚠️ **C5 — EVO AI**: يستخدم local fallback بدلاً من OpenRouter. السبب على الأرجح `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` غير مهيّأ في Vercel env vars. يحتاج فحص.
> - ⚠️ **C6 — Vercel auto-deploy**: المشروع غير مربوط بـ GitHub repo. كل تغيير يحتاج نشر يدوي.
> 
> #### مشاكل عالية الأولوية متبقية (6):
> - H1: عنصر HTML dir="ltr" lang="en" على الصفحات العربية
> - H2: features array في memberships.ts بالعربية فقط
> - H3: نص عربي مُدمج في PlansView الإنجليزي
> - H4: مفاتيح i18n مفقودة (prog.uploadPhoto/photos/noPhotos)
> - H5: اسم "Ahmed Zake" في blog_posts.author
> - H6: /ar/exercises و /ar/foods تُرجع 404
> 
> **الخلاصة**: المشروع أصبح قابلاً للاستخدام التجاري الأساسي بعد إصلاح المشاكل الحرجة الأربعة. التذكرة الوحيدة المتبقية لإطلاق الحملات التسويقية هي إصلاح EVO AI (تحتاج فقط إعداد OPENROUTER_API_KEY في Vercel).
> 
> ### إصلاحات Phase 6 (تسريع AI + إصلاح توليد المقالات — 2026-08-19)
> 
> #### 1. EVO AI Chat Speed + Cleanup (Commit 1)
> - ✅ **`callFreeOpenRouterRace`** — دالة جديدة في `src/lib/ai-provider.ts` تستدعي 3 نماذج بالتوازي (Promise.any) وترجع أول رد ناجح. سرعة 3-8 ثواني بدلاً من 18-25 ثانية.
> - ✅ **Cleanup قوي للـ thinking artifacts** في `src/app/api/ai/chat/route.ts`:
>   - شطف `</think>`, `<reasoning>`, `<reflection>`, `<analysis>` tags
>   - شطف "Here's a thinking process:" / "Thinking process:" / "Reasoning:" headers
>   - استخراج "Final Answer:" / "Draft:" / "Response:" markers
>   - شطف numbered reasoning steps ("1. **Analyze...** 2. **Determine...**")
>   - شطف bullet-style reasoning ("- **Analyze...**")
>   - شطف wrapping quotes
>   - fallback للـ local reply لو النص النظيف أقل من 10 أحرف
> - ✅ **تحسين الـ system prompt** بتعليمات صريحة: "ANSWER DIRECTLY. Do NOT explain your reasoning process" + أمثلة BAD/GOOD
> - ✅ EVO chat الآن يستخدم Race (3 models) + cleanup → ردود سريعة ونظيفة
> 
> #### 2. Plan Generation Speed + Coverage (Commit 2)
> - ✅ **`src/lib/plan-generator.ts`** — كل الـ 4 AI calls محسّنة:
>   - `generateNutritionPlanAI`: timeoutMs 180s → 60s، maxTokens 8000 → 4000
>   - `generateWorkoutPlanAI`: timeoutMs 180s → 60s، maxTokens 8000 → 4000
>   - `regenerateMeal`: timeoutMs 90s → 45s، maxTokens 2000 → 1500
>   - `normalizeCoachPlan`: timeoutMs 120s → 60s، maxTokens 6000 → 4000
> - ✅ **`src/app/api/ai/swap/route.ts`** — تحول لـ `callFreeOpenRouterRace` (3 models parallel):
>   - Meal swap: timeoutMs 90s → 30s، maxTokens 2000 → 1500، maxDuration 180s → 60s
>   - Exercise swap: timeoutMs 60s → 30s، maxTokens 1000 → 800
> - ✅ **`src/app/api/ai/regenerate-meal/route.ts`** — maxDuration = 60s متوافق مع Vercel Hobby
> - ✅ **التحقق من شمول التغذية والتدريب في كل المسارات**:
>   - `/api/ai/plan` (route.ts) — يدعم `planType: "workout" | "nutrition"` ✅
>   - `/api/ai/swap` (route.ts) — يدعم `type: "meal" | "exercise"` ✅
>   - `/api/ai/regenerate-meal` (route.ts) — يدعم إعادة توليد الوجبات ✅
>   - `plan-generator.ts` — يحتوي على `generateNutritionPlanAI` + `generateWorkoutPlanAI` + `regenerateMeal` + `normalizeCoachPlan` ✅
>   - كل المسارات بتسقط لـ local rule-based generator لو فشل OpenRouter ✅
> 
> #### 3. Article Generation Fix (Commit 3) — الأهم
> - ✅ **`src/lib/blog-generate.ts` — Chunked Generation**:
>   - **Chunk 1** (50s): SEO + Research + English article (600-900 كلمة، maxTokens 4000)
>   - **Chunk 2** (50s): Arabic article + FAQ (500-800 كلمة، maxTokens 4000)
>   - **Chunk 3** (40s): Internal/external links + image prompts + social posts (maxTokens 2500)
>   - Chunks 2 + 3 بيتنفذوا **بالتوازي** (Promise.all) → توفير 40 ثانية
>   - `insertLinksIntoArticle` — دالة جديدة لإدراج الروابط في المقالات
> - ✅ **`src/app/api/cron/blog/step2-generate/route.ts`**:
>   - `maxDuration` 60s → **300s** (5 دقائق — يكفي للـ chunked generation)
>   - **دمج Research phase** قبل التوليد (callFreeOpenRouter + 45s timeout)
>   - لو الـ research فشل، التوليد بيكمل بدون research (graceful degradation)
> - ✅ **`src/app/api/ai/research-topic/route.ts`**: maxDuration = 60s (متوافق مع Hobby)
> - ✅ **`src/app/api/ai/generate-article/route.ts`**: maxDuration = 300s (كان مفعل من قبل)
> 
> #### النتائج المتوقعة:
> | الميزة | قبل | بعد |
> |---|---|---|
> | EVO chat | 18-25 ثانية + thinking artifacts | 3-8 ثواني + رد نظيف |
> | Plan generation (تغذية + تمرين) | 90-180 ثانية | 30-60 ثانية |
> | Swap (وجبة + تمرين) | 60-90 ثانية | 10-30 ثانية |
> | Article generation | timeout + مقالات قصيرة | ~100 ثانية + 600-900 كلمة EN + 500-800 AR |
> | Cron blog step2 | 60s timeout = فشل دائم | 300s timeout = نجاح |
> | Research في cron | غير موجود | متكامل (45s) |
> 
> #### التحقق من الجودة:
> - ✅ TypeScript: 0 أخطاء (`./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` نجح)
> - ✅ Next.js build: نجح بدون أخطاء (كل الصفحات اتولدت)
> - ✅ كل المسارات شغالة (EVO + Plans + Swap + Articles + Cron)
> - ✅ Local fallback موجود في كل مكان (لو OpenRouter فشل)
> 
> **الخلاصة النهائية**: المشروع الآن جاهز للإطلاق التجاري مع أداء سريع. كل المشاكل الحرجة محلولة (ما عدا Vercel auto-deploy — يحتاج ربط بـ GitHub يدوياً).
